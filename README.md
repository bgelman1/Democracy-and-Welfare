# Democracy-and-Welfare


This research asks whether support for liberal democracy and interest in politics in general are connected to support for welfare expansion and/or other redistributionist policies, or whether these political projects move separately within American public opinion. I also ask whether this relationship  varies by partisanship, welfare recipient status, and whether this association changed between 2016 and 2020.
